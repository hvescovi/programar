# testing_three
Side project of THREE.js to test some of the features in a local playground.

## Installing dependencies

Run the following command at the repository path:
```
npm install
```

If you want to run the server without the need to restart at every change, install the `nodemon` package:
```
npm install -g nodemon
```

And when running the server, use `nodemon` instead, like:
```
nodemon server.js
```
